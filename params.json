Water can conduct electricity but not very well making it a insulator,Insulators are high in resistance. The resistance is then picked up by my water sensor. This information is then sent to my Galileo through pin 2. This valuable information is then sent to the Wyliodrin platform where its is used by my code that I created. Ny code then determines what tweet to send to the owner based on the resistance given. If it receives a high resistance then the pet bowl is full of water, If there is a low resistance then the bowl is empty.\r\n \r\n### Technology used:\r\nIn my Work i used:\r\n* Intel Galileo Gen2\r\n* Bread board\r\n* Wyliodrin\r\n* Twitter\r\n* Github\r\n\r\n### Thanks to Frank Walsh(Project Lecturer) and Wit for allowing me to do my Project.",
