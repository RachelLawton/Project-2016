# Project-2016

My project is a device the measures the amount of water in a pets bowl and sends a tweet to the owner when the bowl is empty or full.
Water sensor Measures the resistance of water.
Resistance is the ease with which something will let electricity flow through it.
Water has low conductivity properties (insulator) while insulators have a high resistance.

Devices used:
* Intel Galileo
* Wyliodrin IOT Platform
*Twitter

Water Sensor:
* Jumper Wires
